# Sales_Forecasting
his project focuses on analyzing historical sales data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and predict future sales using advanced time series models. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making through insights into sales behavior and accurate forecasting.

The datasets used include a training dataset containing historical sales records and a test dataset for validating the models. Key variables include the date of sales and the corresponding sales figures, among others that may assist in exploratory analysis.

The project involves 

Data Preparation and Cleaning
Ensuring the data is consistent and free of missing values by parsing dates into a standard format and arranging records in chronological order.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generating summary statistics and visualizing sales trends over time to uncover patterns or irregularities.
Seasonal and Trend Analysis
Decomposing the sales data into its seasonal, trend, and residual components to understand how sales vary over time and identify key drivers.

Forecasting Sales
Building predictive models using historical data to forecast future sales. ARIMA modeling is used to capture underlying trends and seasonality in the data.
Exporting Results: Saving forecasted sales values for the next 12 months in a format suitable for further use or presentation.
Key features include identifying sales trends, examining seasonal fluctuations, and using machine learning models to make accurate sales predictions. The outputs include visualizations such as trend and seasonal plots and a forecasted sales dataset.

The project emphasizes the importance of understanding sales patterns, leveraging predictive modeling for strategic planning, and applying advanced analytics for actionable insights. The results can help businesses optimize inventory, resource allocation, and marketing strategies by anticipating sales trends.
